/**
 * How to define types for objects ?
 *  1. Classes -> data members and member functions  
 *  2. Interfaces 
 *  
 *  Using Classes ::
 *      class Car{
 *          name : string 
 *          constructor (name : string){
 *              this.name = name;
 *          }
 * 
 *          display(){
 *              console.log(this.name);
 *          }
 *      };
 * 
 *  Classes contains the implementation of the member functions as well where as interfaces donot implement the member functions
 *  
 *  INTERFACE::
 *      Interface is basically a contract . 
 *      Interfaces are used to define the structure of an object in Typescript.
